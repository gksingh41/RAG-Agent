# THE AI AGENT HANDBOOK FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS

## 1. CORE CONCEPTS
### What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?
The "Brain". It predicts the next word. Examples: GPT-4, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5. 
Limitation: It has no memory of past conversations and cannot access your private data.

### What is an Agent?
An Agent is an LLM wrapped in a "Loop". Instead of just answering, it can:
1. Think ("What should I do?").
2. Act (Use a tool like Google Search).
3. Observe (Read the search result).
4. Answer.
It has "Agency" aka the ability to take action.

### What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?
RAG is like giving the AI an "Open Book Exam". 
Instead of memorizing facts, the AI looks them up in a specific library (Vector Database) before answering.
Flow: User Question -> Search Database -> Get relevant chunks -> Send to AI -> AI Answer.

## 2. THE TECH STACK
### 1. The Orchestrator (The Manager)
Tools: Agno (Phidata), LangChain, LlamaIndex.
Role: Manages the chat history, prompts, and connects the brain to the tools.

### 2. The Vector Database (The Long-Term Memory)
Tools: LanceDB, Pinecone, Qdrant, PGVector.
Role: Stores text as "Numbers" (Embeddings). allows the AI to search for "Concepts" not just "Keywords".
Example: Searching for "Pet" will find "Cat" because they are mathematically close.

### 3. The Embeddings Model
Tools: OpenAI text-embedding-3, Gemini Embeddings.
Role: The translator that converts English text into lists of numbers (Vectors).

## 3. WHY DO WE NEED THESE?
- Why not just use ChatGPT? 
  Because ChatGPT doesn't know your private company data. RAG solves this.
- Why not just use keywords?
  Because "Bank" (River) and "Bank" (Money) look the same to a keyword search, but different to a Vector Search.
